Exploring ICT trading methods and terminogy.

We started off using Databento as a data provider.

Pulled alot of data. data has not been provded here.

There is alot of nice correlations here between assets.

Using His terminolgy we created features to test and for further testing.


Starting with determining the "Draw on liqudity"


We have choosen logistic fregression for up or down in price. and have used XGboost classification to help.


If there was more time, try more models and more ICT terminolgy and trading logic.
